# survey-form-fcc
My Survey Form project from Free Code Camp's Responsive Web Design Certification

## Objective
Create a survey form and style it to be responsive, accessible, and readable.

## Challenges Encountered
- Styling around the browser's built-in form styling. I wanted to change the outline of the textareas when user was typing in them. Learned how to use :focus to change not only the border, but the outline color.
- Formatting text in the welcome note so that text formatting is appealing. I ended up grouping the paragraph into class="welcome-note".

## Future development options
- Continue styling using things like shadow, gradients, and making it look sleeker like modern forms
- Adding additional types of questions to learn more about form options
